		YOU SHOULD ONLY CREATE ONE CASTER PER GUN.
		YOU SHOULD >>>NEVER<<< CREATE A NEW CASTER EVERY TIME THE GUN NEEDS TO BE FIRED.
		
		A caster (created with FastCast.new()) represents a "gun".
		When you consider a gun, you think of stats like accuracy, bullet speed, etc. This is the info a caster stores. 
	
	--
	
	This is a library used to create hitscan-based guns that simulate projectile physics.
	
	This means:
		- You don't have to worry about bullet lag / jittering
		- You don't have to worry about keeping bullets at a low speed due to physics being finnicky between clients
		- You don't have to worry about misfires in bullet's Touched event (e.g. where it may going so fast that it doesn't register)
		
	Hitscan-based guns are commonly seen in the form of laser beams, among other things. Hitscan simply raycasts out to a target
	and says whether it hit or not.
	
	Unfortunately, while reliable in terms of saying if something got hit or not, this method alone cannot be used if you wish
	to implement bullet travel time into a weapon. As a result of that, I made this library - an excellent remedy to this dilemma.
	
	FastCast is intended to be require()'d once in a script, as you can create as many casters as you need with FastCast.new()
	This is generally handy since you can store settings and information in these casters, and even send them out to other scripts via events
	for use.
	
	Remember -- A "Caster" represents an entire gun (or whatever is launching your projectiles), *NOT* the individual bullets.
	Make the caster once, then use the caster to fire your bullets. Do not make a caster for each bullet.
