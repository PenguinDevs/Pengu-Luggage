# ⚠️ This library is incredibly old. I instead prefer to use [Nevermore](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine) instead along with [this](https://github.com/PenguinDevs/PenguinEngine).

# Pengu Luggage
###### This is a Roblox lua package made by me, based on my own preferences. My main purpose of having this open-sourced is to provide a very basic documentation on my libraries to those I work with.

###### I don't plan to have this be fully original, but rather a combination of different modules that I have collected and used over the past years by numerous other coders into here.

## Why did I make this?
###### I dislike Knit's way of loading modules, but love the framework that consists of controllers and services, while on the other hand, I adore RoStrap's way of loading modules, though the problems I have with it is that there are a lot of features that I do not need to touch, as well as some of the outdated features I've noticed that are deprecated and do not function properly, but would love to see it usable today.
